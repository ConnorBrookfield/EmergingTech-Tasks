# EmergingTech-Tasks

## Repository contents
This github repository features a Jupyter Notebook file "EmergingTech-Tasks.ipynb" which outlines 4 research tasks assigned to us by our lecturer.
The four tasks include:
1. Create a function to calculate the Square Root of 2, to 100 decimal places without using a predefined "Square root" function.
2. Use ```scipy.stats``` to verify the chi-squared value and p-value of a specific table.
3. Outline the differences between the excel functions; ```STDEV.S``` and ```STDEV.P```. Demonstrate that the function ```STDEV.S``` provides a better estimate calculation for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample.
4. Use ```scikit-learn``` to apply k-means clustering to Fisher's famous Irish data set.

## How to run a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) locally.
To run a Jupyter notebook file, in this case, "EmergingTech-Tasks.ipynb", you must:
1. Either download and install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) or if you have Python already installed on your machine; Open a command prompt window, and type ```pip install notebook```.
2. Navigate to the the folder containing the "EmergingTech-Tasks.ipynb" file, open a command prompt window in that folder and type: ```jupyter notebook```
3. Jupyter Notebook should open automatically within your default browser, then click the "EmergingTech-Tasks.ipynb" to open that specific notebook.
